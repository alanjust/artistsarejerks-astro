      "category": "ontological",
      "prompt": "Analyze this based on Object-Oriented Ontology (Graham Harman/Timothy Morton).\n\n- The Withdrawal: Treat the artwork as an autonomous object that exists apart from my perception. What part of it 'withdraws' or refuses to be understood?\n- The Flat Ontology: Do not prioritize the human figure over the background or the canvas weave. Treat all elements as having equal 'objecthood.'\n- Verdict: Does this work have a secret life, or does it only exist for the viewer?"

How does the work act on my nervous system before I cognitively label it?\n- Pre-Objective: Describe the sensation of the work before it becomes a 'painting of a thing.'\n- Verdict: Is this an intellectual puzzle or a physical event?"

Where did the material make a decision the artist didn't control?\n- Verdict: Is the artist a dictator of form, or a collaborator with the material?"

Where do they detach?\n- The Death of the Author: Ignore what the artist meant. What does the cultural code of the image say on its own?\n- Verdict: Is this a 'Readerly' text (easy/passive) or a 'Writerly' text (requires me to build the meaning)?"

Search for the weird, the hybrid, and the distinct material sensitivity.\n- The Question: How does this work resist the standard art-historical narrative? Look for the 'slur' or the 'glitch' in the paint.\n- Verdict: Is this work brave enough to be awkward?"

Use non-academic, high-energy language.\n- The Question: Does this work have 'heat'? Does it make you want to steal it or unfriend the artist? Be messy and honest.\n- Verdict: Is this painting alive or dead?"

Connect it to the 'long view' of art history (from textiles to ceramics to painting).\n- The Question: How does this object sit in the physical world? Describe its surface and 'object quality' with extreme precision.\n- Verdict: Does it earn its space on the wall through sheer formal intelligence?"
