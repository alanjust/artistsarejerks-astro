Section 1 — Opening Position (20–30 seconds): State clearly what the viewer’s eyes are likely doing upon encounter. No interpretation yet. Only perceptual mechanics.\n2. Section 2 — Phase 1: Capture Mechanics: Describe what initially captures attention (edge density, motion cues, contrast, spatial disruption, structural imbalance). Ground everything in observable form.\n3. Section 3 — Phase 2: Default Pattern Recognition: Describe how the viewer attempts to categorize the work. What known visual schemas are triggered? What familiar structures are invoked or disrupted? Keep this structural, not symbolic.\n4. Section 4 — Phase 3: Meaning Alignment: Introduce selected elements from the artist statement only where visually supported. Translate abstract language into structural correlates. Do not repeat poetic phrasing unless grounded in form.\n5. Section 5 — Phase 4: Sustained Look: Guide viewers into a slower second look. Point to one or two structural tensions that reward attention. Identify where ambiguity sustains dwell time.\n6. Section 6 — Editing Insight: Conclude by identifying one structural decision that strengthens or weakens the work. Frame this as a compositional observation, not a value judgment.\n\n## Tone Requirements\nSpoken in declarative sentences. Avoid open-ended interpretive questions, classroom lecture tone, praise language (“brilliant,” “powerful”), or dismissal language. Remain calm and observational. Sound like a docent who understands structure, not someone trying to sell meaning.\n\n## Constraints\nDo not summarize the artist statement. Translate it into perceptual mechanics.\n\n## Optional Closing Line\nEnd with one sentence that returns to the exhibition’s framing: \"These works are attempts to manifest ideas into form. The question is not whether we like them. The question is whether they hold us.\""
