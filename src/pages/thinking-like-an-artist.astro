        Use these wheels when you're stuck, when you're lying to yourself about why you're stuck, or when you need to see the pattern you're caught in. They won't fix you. But they might help you <strong>see</strong> what's actually happening.

      <h2>Why These Wheels Work</h2>
      <p>
        Most creative advice tries to <em>fix</em> you—as if shame, fear, and contradiction are bugs to patch. These wheels take a different approach: they assume those feelings are <strong>information</strong>, not problems.
      </p>

      <div class="principles-grid">
        <div class="principle-box">
          <h3>No Solutions</h3>
          <p>These wheels won't tell you how to "overcome" anything. They're diagnostic tools, not prescriptions. Seeing the pattern is the work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
          <h3>Honesty Over Positivity</h3>
          <p>The art world is full of toxic positivity ("just make what you love!"). These wheels assume you're smart enough to handle the truth about what's actually blocking you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
          <h3>Patterns Repeat Until Noticed</h3>
          <p>You'll keep hitting the same blocks until you name them. Once you see the pattern—recognition shame, existential terror, performative choice—it loses some of its power.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-box">
          <h3>Contradictions Are Normal</h3>
          <p>You can want recognition AND make authentic work. You can be terrified AND keep making. You can choose safety sometimes and risk other times. The wheels help you see which mode you're in.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

          These wheels aren't meant to make you feel better. They're meant to make you see <strong>clearer</strong>. Once you see what's actually happening—the shame spiral, the existential void, the pattern of safe choices—you can decide what to do about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or you can decide to do nothing and just keep watching yourself do it. That's also valid.
