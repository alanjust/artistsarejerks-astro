      <p class="subtitle">Understanding Artist Behavior: What's Really Going On</p>
      <p class="description">
        "Artists are jerks" sounds harsh — but it's not the whole story. When artists act dismissive, defensive, or difficult, there's usually something deeper going on. This page unpacks 12 common "jerk behaviors" to reveal the vulnerabilities underneath — and offers compassionate ways to respond.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The goal isn't to excuse bad behavior. It's to understand <strong>why</strong> it happens so we can all engage more thoughtfully with art and artists.

      <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
      <p>
        These behaviors aren't just individual quirks — they're symptoms of how the art world works. The pressure to be "original," the gatekeeping of galleries and institutions, the anxiety about class and taste, the constant comparison and competition — all of this creates impossible psychological positions for many artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you understand what's driving "jerk behavior," you can respond with curiosity instead of judgment. You can ask better questions. You can create safer spaces for vulnerability. And you can start to see the whole ecology of art: the <strong>Good Jerks</strong> who challenge us to see differently, the <strong>Bad Jerks</strong> who gatekeep and exclude, and the <strong>Normies</strong> who keep art accessible and alive in everyday life.
      </p>
      <p class="final-note">
        We need all three to keep the art world functioning — but we need to recognize which is which.
